Sales Prediction with Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting sales using a linear regression model. The dataset includes features such as advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspapers, and the goal is to predict sales based on these features. The project involves training a linear regression model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results to understand the accuracy of the predictions and the model's behavior.

Features:
Data Loading: Loads the dataset containing features for TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising budgets, along with sales data.
Data Preparation:
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Trains a linear regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Displays the model coefficients and intercept.
Visualization:
Actual vs Predicted Sales: Scatter plot comparing actual sales to predicted sales, with a reference line indicating perfect predictions.
Residuals vs Predicted Sales: Scatter plot of residuals (errors) against predicted sales, with a reference line at zero residuals.
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Required Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
